# Hide-Show-Elements-Simple-Way
I'll explain you how I developed a Simple way to Make a Hide and Show elements, Overall The logic will be going to be same To any other objectives you're doing.
Basically we're selecting the Main-container bcz that's the part we have to show and hide, and uses the style property 
to make it visible or disable. so simple the condition means if( It is disable )then make it visible. 
so basically were toggling here.
we write this all things in the functions bcz we have to toggle through or invoke this function through a button
that's why we make a function inside there we wrote our logic and call this function through the button.

That's simple we are doing here.
